        The World Wide Web, also known as the WWW and the Web, is an information space where documents and other web
        resources are identified by Uniform Resource Locators (URLs), interlinked by hypertext links, and accessible via
        the Internet.<span>[1]</span> English scientist Tim Berners-Lee invented the World Wide Web in 1989. He wrote
        the first web browser in 1990 while employed at CERN near Geneva, Switzerland.<span>[2]</span><span>[3]</span>
        The browser was released outside CERN in 1991, first to other research institutions starting in January 1991 and
        to the general public on the Internet in August 1991.

      <p>
        The World Wide Web has been central to the development of the Information Age and is the primary tool billions
        of people use to interact on the Internet.[4][5][6] Web pages are primarily text documents formatted and
        annotated with Hypertext Markup Language (HTML).[7] In addition to formatted text, web pages may contain images,
        video, audio, and software components that are rendered in the user's web browser as coherent pages of
        multimedia content.
      </p>
      <p>
        Embedded hyperlinks permit users to navigate between web pages. Multiple web pages with a common theme, a common
        domain name, or both, make up a website. Website content can largely be provided by the publisher, or
        interactively where users contribute content or the content depends upon the users or their actions. Websites
        may be mostly informative, primarily for entertainment, or largely for commercial, governmental, or
        non-governmental organisational purpose.

        <h1>History</h1>
        <p>Main article: History of the World Wide Web</p>

        <p>The NeXT Computer used by Tim Berners-Lee at CERN.</p>

        <p>The corridor where WWW was born. CERN, ground floor of building No.1</p>
        <p>Tim Berners-Lee's vision of a global hyperlinked information system became a possibility by the second half
          of the 1980s.[8] By 1985, the global Internet began to proliferate in Europe and the Domain Name System (upon
          which the Uniform Resource Locator is built) came into being. In 1988 the first direct IP connection between
          Europe and North America was made and Berners-Lee began to openly discuss the possibility of a web-like system
          at CERN.[9] In March 1989 Berners-Lee issued a proposal to the management at CERN for a system called "Mesh"
          that referenced ENQUIRE, a database and software project he had built in 1980, which used the term "web" and
          described a more elaborate information management system based on links embedded in readable text: "Imagine,
          then, the references in this document all being associated with the network address of the thing to which they
          referred, so that while reading this document you could skip to them with a click of the mouse." Such a
          system, he explained, could be referred to using one of the existing meanings of the word hypertext, a term
          that he says was coined in the 1950s. There is no reason, the proposal continues, why such hypertext links
          could not encompass multimedia documents including graphics, speech and video, so that Berners-Lee goes on to
          use the term hypermedia.[10]</p>

        <p>With help from his colleague and fellow hypertext enthusiast Robert Cailliau he published a more formal
          proposal on 12 November 1990 to build a "Hypertext project" called "WorldWideWeb" (one word) as a "web" of
          "hypertext documents" to be viewed by "browsers" using a clientâ€“server architecture.[11] At this point HTML
          and HTTP had already been in development for about two months and the first Web server was about a month from
          completing its first successful test. This proposal estimated that a read-only web would be developed within
          three months and that it would take six months to achieve "the creation of new links and new material by
          readers, [so that] authorship becomes universal" as well as "the automatic notification of a reader when new
          material of interest to him/her has become available." While the read-only goal was met, accessible authorship
          of web content took longer to mature, with the wiki concept, WebDAV, blogs, Web 2.0 and RSS/Atom.[12]</p>


        <p>The CERN data centre in 2010 housing some WWW servers</p>
        <p>The proposal was modelled after the SGML reader Dynatext by Electronic Book Technology, a spin-off from the
          Institute for Research in Information and Scholarship at Brown University. The Dynatext system, licensed by
          CERN, was a key player in the extension of SGML ISO 8879:1986 to Hypermedia within HyTime, but it was
          considered too expensive and had an inappropriate licensing policy for use in the general high energy physics
          community, namely a fee for each document and each document alteration. A NeXT Computer was used by
          Berners-Lee as the world's first web server and also to write the first web browser, WorldWideWeb, in 1990. By
          Christmas 1990, Berners-Lee had built all the tools necessary for a working Web:[13] the first web browser
          (which was a web editor as well) and the first web server. The first web site,[14] which described the project
          itself, was published on 20 December 1990.[15]</p>

        <p>The first web page may be lost, but Paul Jones of UNC-Chapel Hill in North Carolina announced in May 2013
          that Berners-Lee gave him what he says is the oldest known web page during a 1991 visit to UNC. Jones stored
          it on a magneto-optical drive and on his NeXT computer.[16] On 6 August 1991, Berners-Lee published a short
          summary of the World Wide Web project on the newsgroup alt.hypertext.[17] This date is sometimes confused with
          the public availability of the first web servers, which had occurred months earlier. As another example of
          such confusion, several news media reported that the first photo on the Web was published by Berners-Lee in
          1992, an image of the CERN house band Les Horribles Cernettes taken by Silvano de Gennaro; Gennaro has
          disclaimed this story, writing that media were "totally distorting our words for the sake of cheap
          sensationalism."[18]</p>

        <p>The first server outside Europe was installed at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center (SLAC) in Palo Alto,
          California, to host the SPIRES-HEP database. Accounts differ substantially as to the date of this event. The
          World Wide Web Consortium's timeline says December 1992,[19] whereas SLAC itself claims December 1991,[20][21]
          as does a W3C document titled A Little History of the World Wide Web.[22] The underlying concept of hypertext
          originated in previous projects from the <time>1960s</time>, such as the Hypertext Editing System (HES) at Brown
          University, Ted Nelson's Project Xanadu, and Douglas Engelbart's oN-Line System (NLS). Both Nelson and
          Engelbart were in turn inspired by Vannevar Bush's microfilm-based memex, which was described in the 1945
          essay "As We May Think".[23]</p>

        <p>Berners-Lee's breakthrough was to marry hypertext to the Internet. In his book Weaving The Web, he explains
          that he had repeatedly suggested that a marriage between the two technologies was possible to members of both
          technical communities, but when no one took up his invitation, he finally assumed the project himself. In the
          process, he developed three essential technologies:</p>

        <p>a system of globally unique identifiers for resources on the Web and elsewhere, the universal document
          identifier (UDI), later known as uniform resource locator (URL) and uniform resource identifier (URI);</p>
        <p>the publishing language HyperText Markup Language (HTML);</p>
        <p>the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP).[24]</p>
        <p>The World Wide Web had a number of differences from other hypertext systems available at the time. The Web
          required only unidirectional links rather than bidirectional ones, making it possible for someone to link to
          another resource without action by the owner of that resource. It also significantly reduced the difficulty of
          implementing web servers and browsers (in comparison to earlier systems), but in turn presented the chronic
          problem of link rot. Unlike predecessors such as HyperCard, the World Wide Web was non-proprietary, making it
          possible to develop servers and clients independently and to add extensions without licensing restrictions. On
          30 April 1993, CERN announced that the World Wide Web would be free to anyone, with no fees due.[25] Coming
          two months after the announcement that the server implementation of the Gopher protocol was no longer free to
          use, this produced a rapid shift away from Gopher and towards the Web. An early popular web browser was
          ViolaWWW for Unix and the X Windowing System.</p>

        <p>Scholars generally agree that a turning point for the World Wide Web began with the introduction[26] of the
          Mosaic web browser[27] in 1993, a graphical browser developed by a team at the National Center for
          Supercomputing Applications at the University of Illinois at Urbanaâ€“Champaign (NCSA-UIUC), led by Marc
          Andreessen. Funding for Mosaic came from the US High-Performance Computing and Communications Initiative and
          the High Performance Computing Act of 1991, one of several computing developments initiated by US Senator Al
          Gore.[28] Prior to the release of Mosaic, graphics were not commonly mixed with text in web pages and the
          web's popularity was less than that of older protocols in use over the Internet, such as Gopher and Wide Area
          Information Servers (WAIS). Mosaic's graphical user interface allowed the Web to become, by far, the most
          popular Internet protocol. The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) was founded by Tim Berners-Lee after he left
          the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) in October 1994. It was founded at the Massachusetts
          Institute of Technology Laboratory for Computer Science (MIT/LCS) with support from the Defense Advanced
          Research Projects Agency (DARPA), which had pioneered the Internet; a year later, a second site was founded at
          INRIA (a French national computer research lab) with support from the European Commission DG InfSo; and in
          1996, a third continental site was created in Japan at Keio University. By the end of 1994, the total number
          of websites was still relatively small, but many notable websites were already active that foreshadowed or
          inspired today's most popular services.</p>

        <p>Connected by the Internet, other websites were created around the world. This motivated international
          standards development for protocols and formatting. Berners-Lee continued to stay involved in guiding the
          development of web standards, such as the markup languages to compose web pages and he advocated his vision of
          a Semantic Web. The World Wide Web enabled the spread of information over the Internet through an easy-to-use
          and flexible format. It thus played an important role in popularising use of the Internet.[29] Although the
          two terms are sometimes conflated in popular use, World Wide Web is not synonymous with Internet.[30] The Web
          is an information space containing hyperlinked documents and other resources, identified by their URIs.[31] It
          is implemented as both client and server software using Internet protocols such as TCP/IP and HTTP.
          Berners-Lee was knighted in 2004 by Queen Elizabeth II for "services to the global development of the
          Internet".[32][33]</p>

        <p>
          The terms <dfn>Internet</dfn> and <dfn>World Wide Web</dfn> are often used without much distinction. However,
          the two are not the
          same. The <dfn>Internet</dfn> is a global system of interconnected computer networks. In contrast, the
          <dfn>World Wide Web</dfn> is
          a global collection of documents and other resources, linked by hyperlinks and URIs. Web resources are
          accessed using HTTP or HTTPS, which are application-level Internet protocols that use the Internet's transport
          protocols.
